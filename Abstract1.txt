Abstract—Video stabilization is essential for producing high
quality videos by eliminating unwanted camera motion, resulting
in smooth, steady footage that enhances visual coherence. However,
existing methods often pose several challenges such as the difficulties
in accurately tracking specific objects, and high computational demands.
These limitations hinder the ability to achieve optimal stabilization results
and limit the practical applicability of video stabilization techniques
in real world scenarios. To address these challenges, we introduce a
novel end-to-end method for object-centric video stabilization in the
presence of multiple independent objects. Our approach introduces
two algorithms: 1) Object-Centric Video Stabilization (OCViS),
which facilitates effective detection and tracking of specific objects
within each frame, followed by stabilization with respect to the object
of interest, and 2) Optical Flow based Transformation Accumulation
and Smoothing (OFTrAnS) to remove inherent shakiness and maintain
consistent stabilization, even with multiple independent objects.
Most importantly, our algorithms achieve these results without relying
on deep neural networks or ground-truth data, providing a more efficient
and accessible solution for enhancing video quality on mobile devices
and handheld cameras. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed
approach significantly outperforms a strong baseline by a large margin
emphasizing the efficacy of our method.
